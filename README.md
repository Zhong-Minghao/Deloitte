# Deliotte Sample Code

Welcome,

This repository contains a sample of the work I completed during my tenure as a data analyst at Deloitte. The code provided has been desensitized for privacy reasons, and the original source data cannot be included due to confidentiality constraints.

The purpose of sharing this code is to showcase my work. The code primarily utilizes numpy and pandas for data manipulation, with input and output operations focused on Excel files to facilitate easy usage by colleagues. Additionally, a small graphical user interface sample has been implemented using PyQt5 to demonstrate workflow efficiency enhancements.

Thank you for your interest in reviewing my work.
